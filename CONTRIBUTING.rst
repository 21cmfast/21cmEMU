How to report a bug
-------------------

Report bugs on the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/21cmFAST/21cmEMU/issues>`_.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

* Which operating system and Python version are you using?
* Which version of this project are you using?
* What did you do?
* What did you expect to see?
* What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

How to request a feature
------------------------

Request features on the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/21cmFAST/21cmEMU/issues>`_.

How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------
You need Python 3.8+ and the following tools:

* `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_
* `Nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_
* `nox-poetry <https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/>`_

Install the package with development requirements:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry install

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run python

How to test the project
-----------------------

Run the full test suite:

.. code-block:: console

    $ nox

List the available Nox sessions:

.. code-block:: console

    $ nox --list-sessions

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ nox --session=tests

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the `pytest <https://pytest.readthedocs.io/>`_ testing framework.

How to submit changes
---------------------

Open a `pull request <https://github.com/21cmFAST/21cmEMU/pulls>`_ to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

* The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
* Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
* If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ nox --session=pre-commit -- install

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
